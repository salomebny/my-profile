				<h1>Hello, I'm Lou-Salomé</h1>

				<h2>Environment</h2>
				<p>
					I'm trying to have as little impact on our ecosystem as possible. For several years now, I have been doing a lot of research on global warming and I try to raise the awareness of those around me. At home, for example, our daily lives have been totally transformed, and my mother and I have become vegetarians. In a few months, I plan to become vegan.

				<h2>Social Causes</h2>
				<p>
					I am also very concerned about social causes, especially discrimination. Intolerance is inadmissible to me, whether by gender, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other factor of differentiation. As a matter of fact, I'd like to work in the struggle against racial discrimination. I became interested in it in depth after seeing a film directed by Ava Duvernay, advised by my high school English teacher. Since then, I've watched her entire filmography and I've been doing a lot of research on the subject.

				<h2>Art</h2>
				<p>
					Whether through literature, cinema, dance or painting for example, my mother made me aware of art from a very young age. She took me to see many exhibitions, ballets, plays and operas; she made me read many books and enrolled me in English literature electives in high school; she made me do 5 years of theatre and 10 years of dance... Through various approaches to art, I have come to the conclusion that I do not have an artistic gift, or at least do not like to practice it, but discovering and admiring the art of another has always fascinated me.
